movement but until very recently we have not trained the South Vietnamese We-have hot had an adequate program in the countryside to develop the political and other institutions so that the South Vietnamese once we left would be strong enough to contain these guerrilla activties and as result four years after we have been in South Vietnam the prospect even if the war were to end tomorrow that we could get out all of our immediately of course is quite remote because only when the South Vietnamese develop the economic and political and social and military capability to defend themselves is this war going to come to end Now third major mistake think was the administration s assumption which think was an improper assumption say four years ago three years ago even two years ago that the Soviet Union really wanted to end the war do not believe that facts now bear out that contention and believe our diplomacy should have been used far more effectively and aggressively than it was to enlist the Soviet Union as one of the peacemakers of Vietnam rather than having the situation develop as it has today that the Soviet Union has become the major provider of sophisticated weaponry for North Vietnam Thes are all mistakes of the past They are indications of some of the areas where think if we had moved differently the war could have been brought to successful conclusion at much earlier point Now know that many raise questions as to why will not now indicate well if these talks break down will do this that and the other thing Let me make one thing very clear Just from what President Johnson told the three major candidates yesterday it is true that there is some movement don't want to give any indication that the President made it very clear to all of us that this movement indicates that something may happen for sure or even half sure but there is some movement more diplomatic movement in Paris and Vietnam than there has been in these talks Anything that was said now by potential President as to what he would do if the talks failed would destroy the chance for some progress to be made before the election Therefore am not going to say anthing about that Second man who might be potential President if the war is still going on must have aR the options possible at his disposal and must not paint himself into corner He must not lock himself in by as far as his diplomatic discussion is concerned by things he said in the campaign trust the war will be over or that we will have made substantial progress in reaching conclusion before the election but if it is not over one of the major advantages that will have as new President over Vice President Humphrey is that Continued on the Next Page Nixon Overha Foreign Urges Policy Cont'd from Preceding Pag6 will owe no hostages to the past will not have tied myself in And in negotiations and speak from some experience in many other fields have negotiated where negotiation is concerned the major ingredient to assure success is that the negotiating parties have the broadest possible room to discuss to negotiate in 'hat is why have made it clear that there are two points that limit my negotiations One would not agree to under any circumstances the imposition by negotiation of coalition government with the Communists on South Vietnam because that would lead to in my view encouraging that kind of aggression and also might lead to another war in that area or some place else in the world So rule that out On the other side of the coin have ruled out of course the use of nuclear weapons against North Vietnam but between those broad guidelines there there are number of areas that can of course be discussed in which might take different view from the present administration and consequently am not going to lock myself in three weeks before the election as to what we will say and do because will have better chance to negotiate settlement for this war if my hands are completely free and am not tied will say this that the national interest the interests of our fighting men and the interest of peace in the world require that this war be brought to an honorable conclusion as quickly as possible and whoever is the next President should have just as much running room as possible and try to keep that running room for myself in case have that job Q-- You have deplored rate power like North Koret could seize the Pueblo Whatshould have been done to avoid seizure What should be done now A-What should have been done to avoid seizure was the instant that the ship was threatened the United States should have made it very clear that we would not tolerate seizure and we should have made it clear by moving air and sea power into the area to protect the ship or if we could not protect it we should have moved the ship out from the area Dealing with this is like the prevention of riot in very different sense believe in other words that more firm policy of reacting to any insult to the United States reacting in firm non-belligerent way is needed in order to discourage this kind of ultimate insult You have given great deal of thought to foreign policy over the years most of these years being marked by what Winston Churchill described as the cold war and which you described in your acceptance speech as an era of confrontation with the Cosmunist world You added The time has come for an era of negotiation In view of the many different foreign policy problems in the world today to name few Vietnam the Middle East where Arab nations and Israel seem constantly on the verge of war Eastern Europe and Communist China what changes should be made- In American policies in the future that would end this era of confrontation It won t be ended unfortunately for long time to come but on the other hand skillful negotiation can accomplish what Eisenhower accomplished and that is period of peace without surrender think for the next four years and would trust if we succeed for the next eight years What we need however is to recognize an unpleasant fact at the beginning that the United States is worse off In every major area of the world than it was eight years ago when Eisenhower left office It is worse off in the Middle East worse off in Latin America worse off in Western Europe worse off in Africa and worse off in Asia where we have war Now therefore what we need immediately is new foreign policy team that on priority basis will move to aew initiatives on every one oi these trouble spots sum up around the world we need new policy in Latin America toward the Mideast toward Euope toward the so-called underdeveloped nations forign aid and the rest There is going to be complete reappraisal of American policy We have got to reduce our commitments around the world in those areas where we are overextended so that we can put more emphasis on the priority areas -That is why have made it quite clear that in terms of foreign aid we are not going to be in every country -in the world In many countries we are going to be in less but in those that matter more These are just some of the new directions And then as far as the Soviet Union is concerned the fundamental point want to cover this to be sure if we are going to negotiate with the Soviet Union the United States must be in position to negotiate from strength and not from weakness What is needed therefore is for the United States to strengthen its military forces to strengthen its alliance in Europe so that we can go into negotiations with the Soviet Union and have continuing negotiations with the Soviet Union not from position of immense superior strength which would be considered threat to the Soviet Union that is not what am talking about at al am talking about the strength from defensive standpoint will convince the Soviet Union or any other potential expansionist power that negotiation is much better answer than continuing to bring about these confrontations around the world One subject which bas not been dealt with in detail by any of the candidates Is the question of rising taxes and inflation What steps do you feel must be taken to curb inflation What prospect do you see of reduction of taxes or if not that stability of taxes Well point one the greatest difference between Nixon and Humphrey have talked about foreign policy and have talked about law and order where we do have the basic differences but the greatest differences between these two men is in our attitude toward inflation -Hubert Humphrey once said that he would rather be known as man who was for soft money and had soft heart than man who was known that he was for hard money and had hard heart Well appreciate the sentiment expressed but anybody who makes that kind of statement grave question is raised as to whether he has soft head becau se basically soft money does not mean that man has soft heart Soft money has been responsible for driving 20 million people over 65, living on retirement to the wall Their prices have gone up 20 percent in the last eight years and their income has stayed the same Soft money has resulted in 65 million American wageearners who have had an increase of 14 week average it has resulted in those wage-earners being on treadmill Every bit of increase in wages over the past three years has been eaten up by taxes and inflation That is the problem Now what do you do about it We must move in new direction because the old direction hasn't worked but we also must move in new direction because we otherwise are going to continue to overspend and that means overtax and reduce the value of our currency My administration will be one in which all around in every segment of government we are going to tighten our belt We are going to do what is necessary but do it of course with less money where we are not going to continue on spending spree and the deficit spending which reduces the value of our money believe incidentally that that new kind of policy the policy directed towards eventually achieving balanced budget during period of prosperity that that kind of policy will stop the rise in prices and also that it eventually will lead not only to stopping the rise in taxes but reduction in taxes Another difference between Mr Humphrey and myself He has indicated that the surtax war tax that was added by Congress in the last term should be continued permanently don't agree believe just as soon as we can get our economy in shape that that tax should be dispensed with because firmly believe that the tax burden is too high and must be reduced and finally-in the field of taxation-do favor general tax reform That will 'come of course when within the administration we have had an opportunity to assess our situation around the world
