Such long-standing ties have always been the key to politics in state where until the emergence of the Negro mass voting blocs played no role Sen Eastland's power base Is therefore embedded in firstname dealings with thousands of Mississippi business men and bankers leading lawyers the power companies and the state s major newspaper publishers and television station owners By contrast the 55,000member Mississippi Labor Council an -C LO liberal affiliate that opposes the senator remains largely impotent as political force One reason good many of the union members are also in the Ku Klux Klan Thus there Is no Democratio party organization as such only an Eastiland organization which has at times been turned out for other state candidates under pattern of loose and endlessly shifting alliances Another anchor of the Eastland machine is the country supervisor system Every country is divided into districts each of which elects supervisor The supervisors retain control of road contracts and other local patronage Their work is meshed smoothly with Sen Eastland's Federal power -for example the naming of rural mail carriers As result of these ties and the banding together of Mississippi Democrats as never before in their often-warring history Sen Eastland appears confidently unconcerned over the threat from Rep Walker 49-year-old chicken farmer from Mize Miss who was elected to Congress in the 1964 state sweep by Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater The Eastland machine forces either aided Goldwater or else sat on their hands Walker can t run as racist Sen Eastland sa ya gleefully He appointed Negro to the Air Force Academy We have the proof On the other hand Rep Walker also has recently attended meeting of the Americans for the Preservation of the White Race which Sen Eastland is the first to brand as front for the Klan We have affidavits an Eastland aid reported from persons who saw Walker walking around with Klansmen in their robes Eastland was also invited to the meeting but failed to attend The -C Is against me and the Klan is against me Sen Eastland says pleased at the apparent balance To his way of thinking the vast majority of Mississippi voters stand somewhere between the two groups Rep Walker for his part has called the senator double-standard Democrat meaning that he Is an Administration man in Washington While in most other states such charge would be pointless It can mean excommunication in the upsidedown world of Mississippi politics There is germ of truth In the Walker charge Sen Eastland for example had smooth working relationship with Sen Robert Kennedy D-N When the senator was Attorney General The same holds true for the present Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach Yet the deepest source of Eastland strength in the capital steps from his power over Federal judicial appointments Sure can get fellow named to the bench without Eastland Western Democrat noted But it s hell of lot easier when he s on your side Thus Mississippi's senior senator can swap all sorts of unwritten contracts that in time reap benefits to his state with other senators in return for his support of their judicial nominees The result is that the judiciary chairman is able to do lot more for his state through his back-stage dealings with the administration than were he really-as he claims to be-an implacable foe of the President In any event while Missis like Federal aid they detest the thought of an all- powerful government in Washington so it is poor politics to trumpet one s suc- cesses In the Federal vineyard None of the nuances however are perceived when Sen Eastland campaigns in rural Mississippi It is world of small talk conservatism and racism Before giving his Rotary Club speech in Tunica in the northwest corner of the state the Senator stopped to visit the country s leading farm equipment dealer who happens to be distant cousin of the senator s Sen Eastland expressed his concern over the mounting Negro vote More than 6000 of Tunica County's 16,000 citizens are Negroes Its schools are -that is there are two Negro first-graders in the entire consolidated white school system hear you may have 500 here' the senator said His cousin assured him that this was wrong but just to make sure he placed call to the county clerk s office How many niggers you got registered the senator s cousin asked Five hundred that many The cousin put down the receiver They started coming in six months ago but they trailed off he expained They're not coming in now he added as everyone nodded After the Rotary's chicken lunch the senator attacked falling cotton prices 15 proposed minimum wage for field hands inflation foreign aid and strong central government before finally turn ing to the race Issue My friends he said there is coming to the Senate another civil rights bill just as far-reaching as any It gives the Fed era 1 government power to say who sits on jury In our courthouse in Tunica It gives the Attorney General power to bring about massive school integration whereby the Federal government would control our school systems But the senator predicted that the fair-housing provision in the new administration bill is not going to pass was told he said by some high officials that it would be knifed by the liberals talked to Senate Majority Leader Everett McKinley Dirksen about that he continued said big Dirk have they told you about this civil rights bill Why think with few amendments we can go along he said to me How about those real estate provisions Sen Eastland asked his colleague Well he said I've got grave doubts To the satisfaction of the assembled Rotarians Sen Eastland then summed up the racial scene this way Northern people believe in racial segregation just as much as any man In this audience and their civil rights measures are not go ing to be enforced the way they are in the South Are they going to bus school children in New York city If we are ever going to take stand we ve got to take it now We can t have violence That won t work But we ve got to oppose them within the law As matters stand Sen Eastland said several big northern states control politics He observed Nobody is going to get New York State-with its 44 electoral votes-without the Liberal party You complement them when you call them socialists They are Reds and Marxists The Eastiand solution for Mississippi's ills is therefore constitutional convention that would reapportion the electoral college on state-by-state percentage of the vote basis Despite the burning race question Sen Eastland thinks that the issue in the state today is the Viet Nam war The Eastland view is that Ameri can soldiers shouldn't be fight ing that kind of war We can t he adds get rid of all
