there has been some movement but until very recently we have not trained the South Vietnamese We-have hot had an adequate program in the countryside to develop the political and other institutions so that the South Vietnamese once we left would be strong enough to contain these guerrilla activties and as result four years after we have been in South Vietnam the prospect even if the war were to end tomorrow that we could get out all of our immediately of course is quite remote because only when the South Vietnamese develop the economic and political and social and military capability to defend themselves is this war going to come to end Now third major mistake think was the administration s assumption which think was an improper assumption say four years ago three years ago even two years ago that the Soviet Union really wanted to end the war do not believe that facts now bear out that contention and believe our diplomacy should have been used far more effectively and aggressively than it was to enlist the Soviet Union as one of the peacemakers of Vietnam rather than having the situation develop as it has today that the Soviet Union has become the major provider of sophisticated weaponry for North Vietnam Thes are all mistakes of the past They are indications of some of the areas where think if we had moved differently the war could have been brought to successful conclusion at much earlier point Now know that many raise questions as to why will not now indicate well if these talks break down will do this that and the other thing Let me make one thing very clear Just from what President Johnson told the three major candidates yesterday it is true that there is some movement don't want to give any indication that the President made it very clear to all of us that this movement indicates that something may happen for sure or even half sure but there is some movement more diplomatic movement in Paris and Vietnam than there has been in these talks Anything that was said now by potential President as to what he would do if the talks failed would destroy the chance for some progress to be made before the election Therefore am not going to say anthing about that Second man who might be potential President if the war is still going on must have aR the options possible at his disposal and must not paint himself into corner He must not lock himself in by as far as his diplomatic discussion is concerned by things he said in the campaign trust the war will be over or that we will have made substantial progress in reaching conclusion before the election but if it is not over one of the major advantages that will have as new President over Vice President Humphrey is that Continued on the Next Page Nixon Overha Foreign Urges Policy Cont'd from Preceding Pag6 will owe no hostages to the past will not have tied myself in And in negotiations and speak from some experience in many other fields have negotiated where negotiation is concerned the major ingredient to assure success is that the negotiating parties have the broadest possible room to discuss to negotiate in 'hat is why have made it clear that there are two points that limit my negotiations One would not agree to under any circumstances the imposition by negotiation of coalition government with the Communists on South Vietnam because that would lead to in my view encouraging that kind of aggression and also might lead to another war in that area or some place else in the world So rule that out On the other side of the coin have ruled out of course the use of nuclear weapons against North Vietnam but between those broad guidelines there there are number of areas that can of course be discussed in which might take different view from the present administration and consequently am not going to lock myself in three weeks before the election as to what we will say and do because will have better chance to negotiate settlement for this war if my hands are completely free and am not tied will say this that the national interest the interests of our fighting men and the interest of peace in the world require that this war be brought to an honorable conclusion as quickly as possible and whoever is the next President should have just as much running room as possible and try to keep that running room for myself in case have that job Q-- You have deplored rate power like North Koret could seize the Pueblo Whatshould have been done to avoid seizure What should be done now A-What should have been done to avoid seizure was the instant that the ship was threatened the United States should have made it very clear that we would not tolerate seizure and we should have made it clear by moving air and sea power into the area to protect the ship or if we could not protect it we should have moved the ship out from the area Dealing with this is like the prevention of riot in very different sense believe in other words that more firm policy of reacting to any insult to the United States reacting in firm non-belligerent way is needed in order to discourage this kind of ultimate insult You have given great deal of thought to foreign policy over the years most of these years being marked by what Winston Churchill described as the cold war and which you described in your acceptance speech as an era of confrontation with the Cosmunist world You added The time has come for an era of negotiation In view of the many different foreign policy problems in the world today to name few Vietnam the Middle East where Arab nations and Israel seem constantly on the verge of war Eastern Europe and Communist China what changes should be made- In American policies in the future that would end this era of confrontation It won t be ended unfortunately for long time to come but on the other hand skillful negotiation can accomplish what Eisenhower accomplished and that is period of peace without surrender think for the next four years and would trust if we succeed for the next eight years What we need however is to recognize an unpleasant fact at the beginning that the United States is worse off In every major area of the world than it was eight years ago when Eisenhower left office It is worse off in the Middle East worse off in Latin America worse off in Western Europe worse off in Africa and worse off in Asia where we have war Now therefore what we need immediately is new foreign policy team that on priority basis will move to aew initiatives on every one oi these trouble spots sum up around the world we need new policy in Latin America toward the Mideast toward Euope toward the so-called underdeveloped nations forign aid and the rest There is going to be complete reappraisal of American policy We have got to reduce our commitments around the world in those areas where we are overextended so that we can put more emphasis on the priority areas -That is why have made it quite clear that in terms of foreign aid we are not going to be in every country -in the world In many countries we are going to be in less but in those that matter more These are just some of the new directions And then as far as the Soviet Union is concerned the fundamental point want to cover this to be sure if we are going to negotiate with the Soviet Union the United States must be in position to negotiate from strength and not from weakness What is needed therefore is for the United States to strengthen its military forces to strengthen its alliance in Europe so that we can go into negotiations with the Soviet Union and have continuing negotiations with the Soviet Union not from position of immense superior strength which would be considered threat to the Soviet Union that is not what am talking about at al am talking about the strength from defensive standpoint will convince the Soviet Union or any other potential expansionist power that negotiation is much better answer than continuing to bring about these confrontations around the world One subject which bas not been dealt with in detail by any of the candidates Is the question of rising taxes and inflation What steps do you feel must be taken to curb inflation What prospect do you see of reduction of taxes or if not that stability of taxes Well point one the greatest difference between Nixon and Humphrey have talked about foreign policy and have talked about law and order where we do have the basic differences but the greatest differences between these two men is in our attitude toward inflation -Hubert Humphrey once said that he would rather be known as man who was for soft money and had soft heart than man who was known that he was for hard money and had hard heart Well appreciate the sentiment expressed but anybody who makes that kind of statement grave question is raised as to whether he has soft head becau se basically soft money does not mean that man has soft heart Soft money has been responsible for driving 20 million people over 65, living on retirement to the wall Their prices have gone up 20 percent in the last eight years and their income has stayed the same Soft money has resulted in 65 million American wageearners who have had an increase of 14 week average it has resulted in those wage-earners being on treadmill Every bit of increase in wages over the past three years has been eaten up by taxes and inflation That is the problem Now what do you do about it We must move in new direction because the old direction hasn't worked but we also must move in new direction because we otherwise are going to continue to overspend and that means overtax and reduce the value of our currency My administration will be one in which all around in every segment of government we are going to tighten our belt We are going to do what is necessary but do it of course with less money where we are not going to continue on spending spree and the deficit spending which reduces the value of our money believe incidentally that that new kind of policy the policy directed towards eventually achieving balanced budget during period of prosperity that that kind of policy will stop the rise in prices and also that it eventually will lead not only to stopping the rise in taxes but reduction in taxes Another difference between Mr Humphrey and myself He has indicated that the surtax war tax that was added by Congress in the last term should be continued permanently don't agree believe just as soon as we can get our economy in shape that that tax should be dispensed with because firmly believe that the tax burden is too high and must be reduced and finally-in the field of taxation-do favor general tax reform That will 'come of course when within the administration we have had an opportunity to assess our situation around the world",local,1968,10,boston,massachusetts,northeast

picture of real estate property they bought and it was pretty distressing real estate picture But we accepted their plan and agreed to finance it on mortgage ba sis since we were familiar with the developers' past experiences The speaker is Allan Glidden vice president for real estate and mortgage Investments for Mutual Life Insurance Co of New York MONY Glidden who also Is president of MONY Mortgage Investors real es tate investment trust subsidiary of MONY was referring to the develop ment firm East Bay Development Corp of Somerville The property he was talking about Is the 52-acre for mer Ford assembly plant in Somer ville which in later years served also as distribution and administrative center for First National Stores The property along Mystic and Middlesex avenues in Somerville cur rently Is undergoing major recycling effort by East Bay prominent shop ping center developer The Initial recy cling plan is just about completed after more than year of intensive construction work Part of the total investment in volves 19 million channeled into 26-acre portion of the site dominated by the old huge 1 194 feet long and 301 feet wide Ford assembly plant build ing Under new skylight roof of the old plant cluster of new small shops should be opening later this month to be followed by other groups of retail outlets as construction Is- completed The aim is to turn the spaces into an old-fashioned 1920s Interior shopping street complete with old fashioned lamp posts brick paving and plant ers and lot of early 1900s decora tions The K-Mart department store is al ready in place and in operation Other stores will be joining K-Mart in about two weeks Glidden speaks enthusiastically about the current trend of recycling old properties and notes that insur ance firms such as his look at such projects with favor when developers seek loans But he also admits that he and his firm like many other lenders In the country In earlier years wouldn't give dime to developers contemplating such rehabilitation ventures In our business we tend generally to be bit conservative and want to be shown says Glidden But I'm convert he says and speaks highly about the many recy cling projects In Boston Itself such as the Faneull Hall Marketplace pro- ject which we turned down as lend ers Glidden makes two points about his own insurance company and oth ers around the country One is that their early reluctance to deal with old properties has changed considerably the second Is that firms such as his are now shifting from roles as mort gage lenders to being real estate equity partners with developers to whom they lend MONY although based In New York City Is major Bay State shop ping center lender with mortgage lending interests In Auburn Fra- Swampscott Methuen Sa lem and Westfield It holds many of them with East Bay such as the let ter s shopping center developments In Chelsea and Billerica And MONY apparently is making East Bay's vision of multi-use inten sive development out of the Somerville property reality Today MONY likes the plan lot better than when it first made mortgage commitment about year and half ago In fact the firm is building up to 50 percent ownership of the shopping mall and Glidden says the firm Is seeking part ownership of the proper ties in new projects seeking long term mortgage loans The erratic nature of the mortgage lending rate Is making the fixed inter est loan obsolete and while MONY is willing to grant fixed loans it will con tinue to do so for an equity position Even at that Glidden admits that the Interest rate to the borrower is made at market rate levels So the borrower has to share the ownership Just to get loan at market rates We have accepted the fact that if we are' going to have ongoing Inflation and all the economists seem to ex pect this we cannot any longer af ford fixed mortgage commitments of 20 year terms said Glidden Glidden native of Boston says MONY originally viewed Assembly Square as little appalling Industri alized and not pretty and not subur ban But when you figure the and density of the area it seems to be tremendously logical to assume successful retail operation Jordan Marsh which plans to be an anchor tenant and K-Mart the other anchor store apparently agree East Bay already has completed major renovation of the old First Na tional Stores offices Into prime office space Glidden says his firm Is not part owner In this nor does it expect to be In hotel that comes In later stage since MONY Is not aggressively pursuing Investments In hotels The

themselves at the Natural Organic Farmers' Association annual meeting at Lyndon State College here in far northern Vermont When you do it right Houriet said the carrot tops are right close together

agriculture farm functions like an organism it functions like totality along certain biological principles we have to understand Dr Koetf said 'There is no point escaping to some kind of romantic

farms demonstrations by snorting work horses and lectures on everything from drying beans to child rearing were all part of the conference Michael Levine coordinator of the three-day get-together said yesterday that its purpose is twofold giving new young the practical information they need to turn away from large scale agribusiness methods and mass markets and giving them also the support and inspiration they need to persevere in that effort There's so little known about small- agriculture now that most people really don't have any place else to go Levine said Most of these people are in the vanguard of developing this sort of agriculture Levine said he had been forced to close registration when the conference reached 800 participants More than 400 other interested person were turned away for lack of space Like many of the conference participants grain Francis Angier of Addison said yesterday that he sees resurgence of interest in small-scale farming in New England Unlike many of the conference participants Angier has been farmer himself for more than 30 years The place for the big farms is to feed the cities Angier said The small farms should produce and sell their products locally -in the country And said Angier and others at the conference small farms are valuable stand-by force in case of any national emergency that might stall the complicated economic system that now supplies New England with most of its food 'If an atom plant blows up like that Three Mile Island plant almost did or if the transportation system breaks down when gas goes out of sight New Englanders

most of the people at the conference this weekend the is agribusiness the big corporate farms and nationwide marketing systems that now dominate farming and food across the US Vermont's mostly small farms still Angier said But some of the operations here are getting too big Angier refers to some of the state s biggest dairy farms as bovine concentration camps and says that the people running them aren't farming they re ego tripping The main thing he said is that big-scale farming really isn't farming anymore It's business With big' farms it s no fun it s just managing University of Vermont Extension Service agent Win ston Way long proponent of small-scale farming foi Vermont and New England said he sees split the big farms and the small farms But Way noted there is room in the economy for both In lecture yesterday morning Way predicted resurgence of small farms and local food marketing My goal he said is local abundance According to Way big agriculture is in trouble because of its close links to the national economy Inflation and the rising cost of petroleum labor and materials are pushing agribusiness to dangerous extremes he said Farmers 4re being taught not to conserve but to squander he aid The problem with big farms is that they go land with consuming vengeance rather than with kind of love Way said that more careful loving relationship between the land is necessary if farming is to prosper in the future He told the young farmers and would-be farmers that the success of the back-to-theland movement would be largely up to them We can adopt new simpler lifestyle we

Mississippi stood in lome s Plazza di Spagna and at the well-dressed affluent crowds the wellstocked shop windows and the glut of new and shiny cars The scene that spread before them -of traffic jams thriving restaurants crowds of tourists and joking Italian youngsters strolling arm in arm seemed out of place with recent press reports about Italy's terrorism university radicalism and inadequate social services But the most obvious disparity was with the Italy they had known in the closing days of the war and in the period immediately after low it s all changed said oneof the Yesagreed the other It sure was different then The last time the two had been in Rome was in early 1946, shortly after World War II had ended In thoe days most people were shabbily dressed Food was scarce the streets empty of traffic and nice girls wore high-necked blouses and skirts and were reluctant to go out on date without chaperone In those days the steps leading up to Trinita Doi Monti were bare of today s crowds of hippy-looking youngsters mostly long-haired and bearded boys or braless girls in scanty tops and tight-fitting jeans The scores of West European American and Japanese tourists had not yet arrived And Aldo Gucci's famous leather store in Via Condotti had not yet become the international mecca it is today Furthermore in those days the Vatican's presence was so strongly felt that most passing Italians knew that the squat massive building at the end of the piazza was the headquarters of Roman Catholic missionaries and the propagation of the Rooan Catholic faich Today for most it is just another palazzo Back then Italy had just emerged from 20 years of Fascism and from disastrous war begun by Bonito Mussolini that had left the country with the humiliating status of defeated nation For the last 35 years the country has been ruled by democratically elected parliamentary government From the start Italy's postwar leaders made point of seeing that their country was closely tied to the West and thoroughly integrated into the new political and economic institutional network that frustrated Europeans quickly began to build Back then with the Cold War just around the corner Communist-noncommunist hostilities seemed likely to bring the country to the point of civil war Today with the Communists' share of the national vote at close to 35 percent and their support essential for the survival of minority Christian Democratic government those fears have been largely overcome The newly elected president of the republic is former partisan and promi nent Socialist The president of the lower house of parliament the Chamber of Deputies is man who 30 years ago many Italians would have been inclined to call dirty red Back then however the major question on people s minds was now to avoid starvation and stay alive Other prime concerns were to rebuild the country s largely destroyed roads and railroads increase industrial production which had dropped 75 percent between 1938 and 1945, stop rampant inflation and find for the hordes of unemployed Today despite innumerable problems high inflation and unemployment among the young the country is enjoying European levels of prosperity Italy is now one of the world s 10 most developed nations with an annual per capita income of close to 4000 over 5000 miles of autostrade or expressways and with more than million new cars on the road each year Illiteracy has been almost totally eliminated The number of university graduates per year has tripled since 1963 ani 77 percent of high school graduates now go on to college The country has won universal recognition for its proficiency in design fash- ion and manufacturing of clothes shoes leather products office machines motor vehicles and food preserves It also ranks high on most foreign tourists lists 'today we are once again real country nation one can be proud of says Pietro Borga 68-year-old former shoemaker who remembers when coffee drinkers had to

never or rarely ever had it so good said an Italian doctor who is annoyed by the tendency of the foreign press to write only of what doesn't work in Italy and to forget just how much progress has been made Purse-snatchings kidnapings political violence slow mails inflation and overcrowded schools and hospitals make good copy he says but they don't tell the story as whole And although Italians themselves tend to be persuasive pessimists whose favorite words are crisis and collapse the fact is that Italy has changed incredibly from the gloomy days of the late forties and the changes have brought with them both good and bad For example the massive immigration northward from the improverished south gave many Italians the possibility to -v both their earning power and their education It also placed an enormous strain on public facilities and social services that to this day has yet to be resolved causing semipermanent pockets of poetry and creating unfulfilled aspirations that inevitably led to an increase in crime The massive unionization that during the late fifties and early has guaranteed most workers and employees by Italian standards ad health and education But it also the cheap labor that together with American aid enabled the country to make speedy economic recovery and encouraged headstrong union leaders to resort to frequent and disruptive strikes that have made life difficult for visitors and many average Italians Government largesse and political patronage have provided jobs for many poorly skilled or unmotivated persons But the result has been and unwieldly central bureaucracy that often appears totally unequipped to deal with the day-to-day needs of modern industrialized country Left-wing pressures for greater social benefits have provided most Italians with free hospital drugs and medical care as well as with the chance to go to college as long as they have high school degree But there has been little planning to accompany these worthwhile aims with the result that hospital are overcrowded the public budget is deeply into the red and the country s teeming universities often appear to specialize in the creation of violence-prone intellectuals with little employment future Finally the 1948 constitution reintroduced the principles of democracy afters brutal dictatorship of more than 20 years But superimposed on country which for historical reason has had little sense of the state the system has ben transformed into one in which the patronage-heavy influence of Italy's political parties extends into almost every sector of life This means that party politics has been more concerned with ideological disputes and with power-sharing deals than with legislative work that world take prompt efficient action on nitty-gritty problems In fact sweeping reform bills regarding the police the bureaucracy pensions taxes universities and health that have been the parliament for years are still pending and there is little indication that passage or application tire now near Nevertheless other law that have been passed over the last 10 or 15 years have transformed Italy from family-oriented and church-controlled society to one much more in tune with developments in other parts of the West revised family law divorce and abortion have brought Italy to the Point of social says feminist lawver who believes that the recent laws have gone far in opening the door for the liberation ot Italy's largely culture- WVtOtei But insists conservative priest these innovations along with the open university policy that has flooded our colleges with political activists have alto had negative effects As in the unsuccessful church-sponsored antidivorce campaign of 1974. he attributed increased drug use continuing prostitution extensive political violence spreading pornography and growing dissemination of birth control information on laws leading to the dissolution of the family Certainly Italy today is like most 'other countries in the West not an entirely tranquil place Growing crime and sluggish courts have lead to overcrowded prisons Drug use is spreading among youths whose future is jeopardized by an economic recession and political with inaction and the mellowing of the once- Communist Party has frequently inspired thousands of youths to take to the streets preferring to the ballot or in the most extreme cases to team up with several clandestine terrorist groups Iecent years have not been easy for Italy and 1978 with the savage murder of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro made many Italians feel that the bottom had been reached But there is another side to Italy one which rarely gets into the headlines and which hasn't changed much since 1946 when reborn country drew itself out of the of the war This is the Italy made up of hundreds of thousand of people who work hard to earn living struggle to bring tip their children and hasten to lend hand to troubled neighbor or passerby This Italy was very much in evidence one recent Sunday when 200,000 people by no means all of them Catholic quietly turned up in Turin to attend public display of the holy shroud It is the Italy that still lays

657764413,1975-10,Boston Globe (1960-),"boston, mass","As John O'Connor spokesman for the insurance industry said It worked beyond anyone s wildest dreams For instance the bodily injury coverage required by law to put vehicle on the road in the Bay State cost Boston resident 117 in 1970, the last year prior to no-fault This year it cost 45 and even if the received the entire 244 million increase seek for 1976, the compulsory coverage would only increase to 57 which is still 50 percent below what it was five years ago But today s problems in the industry concern the other side of insurance the property damage side which protects motorists against any damage to his own automobile or damage he might cause to another vehicle It is the property damage coverage particularly coverage against damage resulting from collision vandalism fire and theft which concerns the insurance industry and which is generating the pressure for higher rates The industry says more than 80 percent of its 244 million request is necessitated by losses experienced in paying claims on vehicle damages or theft The answer to why the companies are having so much trouble making the profit they are allowed to make by law in the vehicle damge area is 'as as the field of automobile insurance itself But most experts agree there are particular causes which can be pinpointed some of which are national in scope and cannot be remedied at the state level and some of which can be rectified by changes in the whic establish how the insurance industry is regulated in Massachusetts AUTO INSURANCE Page 38 Insurance firms drivers on collision course Inflation sends claims rates spiraling AUTO INSURANCE Continued from Page 37 The nationwide problem is one of Inflation in the cost of repairing automobiles For instance the cost of front end and rear end parts most frequently damaged in accidents increased by close to 50 in the last two years according to the Motor Crash Estimating Guide the standard pricing index used by insurance companies and repair shops But most experts also agree that the problems with vehicle damage coverage today result from spate of laws passed early in this decade which make It easier for the motorist to collect but which also are contributing to higher rates as motorists take advantage of those laws As Comr Stone said After no fault for bodily injury was passed and legislators saw it worked so well somebody said 'let s reform the property damage laws too So lot of laws were passed that gave people lot of rights all of which sounded like good pieces of consumer legislation on paper Stone said The problem was they all added losses to the insurance system without giving the companies any way of making up the difference Stone singled out several specific laws including One which abolished the merit systern in Massachusetts so that today must insure anybody who wants insurance and all at the same rate no matter what the driver s accident record Because of this Stone said There's no disincentive as far as reporting minor accidents is concerned Another law which requires companies to pay vehicle damage claims within 15 days This is also helpful for consumers but it often doesn't give companies enough time to investigate and as result they often don't Investigate at all Stone said Two other laws which when coupled allow the less than honest to take advantage of the system These include law which requires companies to pay for the repair of damage regardless of whether the owner has the repairs done and law which requires companies to pay book value for stolen automobiles regardless of their condition Stone laid out the following In describing how people take advantage of those two laws Suppose you have 2800 car and you get in an accident which causes 1000 damage to the car You collect 1000 from the insurance company andthen drive the banged up car around rather than get it fixed Then the car Is mysteriously stolen and the company must pay you 2800 for the car despite the fact it was all smashed up There are people Who make living at that Still another law has in effect made the alternative of buying no collision insurance at all financially undesirable That law allows company to sue company in cases where the automobile insured by is damaged by car insured by and on which the owner has no collision coverage This law has forced the companies to make no-collision coverage as expensive to customers as the limited collision coverage which protects motorists as long as the other guy ih at fault It has also injected more than 20 million in additional claims against the companies into the system according to Stone Whether it s the result of these laws or the fact that people are more In recessionary times is not entirely clear but there s no doubt that the number of claims under the vehicle damage insurance is sharply rising In 1973, there were 616,600 claims in this area compared to 746,000 last year That's an increase of just over 21 percent The increase Is even greater during the first six months of this year according' to Industry figures and if current trends continue the companies project situation for next year whereby claim would be filed by one out of every two drivers in Massachusetts There are 2.3 million drivers in the state All this is now being studied by special 13-member commission headed by state Sen Daniel Foley DWorcester which meets for three days next week in an to come up with some reforms before next year s rates go into effect But if most people agree on what s causing the problem there is no unanimity on what changes should be made The industry is pushing hard for mandatory 250 deductible for all collision and comprehensive fire and theft coverage That would mean the owner would pay the first 250 of any damage done to his car Coupled with this proposal is what the industry calls buy back provision which would allow motorists to lower the deductible if they were willing to pay higher premium This would cut in half the Industry's 244 million request for next year to 122 million according to Lemuel Devers an industry spokesman But Comr Stone among others is opposed to the concept on the basis that it would be just another way of giving them the rate increase Stone however agrees with the that there should be some sort of merit rating system if only to create an incentive for motorists to drive more safely and file fewer small claims Stone also feels that any laws which allow motorists to make profit on the system such As that which allows them to collect for physical damages without necessarily fixing the car should be amended And he also favors repealing the law which makes no collision Insurance as expensive as the limited fault collison insurance But most important to Stone is the necessity of infusing more competition into an industry which has become so highly regulated by the state that none presently exists Under the present system the state insurance commission by establishing all rates sets price umbrella for the industry as whole Stone said This allows the inefficient companies to stay in business and allows the efficient companies to make lots of money Stone would continue to regulate those parts of insurance which are most crucial to consumers on an industry-wide basis These would include compulsory bodily injury liability coverage and protection against what he called catastrophic losses in the vehicle damage area But other coverages he said should be regulated on company by company basis allowing each company to come in with its own proposals-within limits Several industry officials in interviews last week agreed with the idea that more competition would be beneficial Richard Underwood the New England regional vice president of the-American Insurance Assn said Under the current setup with rates being set for the entire year if company has good first quarter and they would like to lower rates for the rest of the year they can t do it until the next year That discourages good management I'm not taking right wing free enterprise position but I'm Just saying

District Court issued his long awaited order on busing at noon Monday The Court issued two lengthy documents The first is Remand Order where the Court attempts to buttress its earlier decision of August 31. 1976, where he found the school board and the superintendents both city and state guilty of wilfully discriminating against the assignment of black students The second order is the plan to desegregate the schools The more than 110 pages of the plan require extensive massive busing from East to West and West to East The plan in its initial stages seems to dwell mostly on pairings of the high school districts The plan really is not new It is re-worked version of plans first submitted by the Board and then some adjustments were made by the Special Master Daniel McCarthy and finally the Court Several things still remain unanswered in the plan How many schools will be closed Will the Court follow the pattern in some cities where all the inner city schools are closed and blacks shipped out How many white children from areas Lakewood and other suburbs are coming to 55th and Outhwalte Io go to school How many black children will be bused our to the West Side 11 schools are closed and teachers laid off wilt the familiar tactic of tast hired tirst fired be and erode the advantages and positions blacks have found and won In the school system As the population In Cleveland continues

pointedly extracted from each of the witnesses that he the Judge was not responsible Michael Hoffman Clerk Treasurer of the Board started as the first witness testifying to the tact that the school system was in financial squeeze due to decreasing tax base lack of sufficient state support and failure of Penn Central Railroad to pay nearly 15 million in delinquent taxes In dull session representative from the State Auditor's Office testified that the school system in Cleveland had followed the state law in its accounting procedures The Special Master Daniel McCarthy quizzed the deputy auditor extensively on the accounting methods and what McCarthy thought was need to update the procedure to conform to accounting practices followed by large corporations An economist highlighted the fact that 160 school districts in Ohio are in serious financial trouble in trying to stay open Dr Bruce Gensemen Professor of Economics at Kenyon College testified that big city school

of the schools in Cleveland relate to lack of adequate state aid and not to mismanagement Briggs was able to point out that Cleveland's problems are not unique when considering The State cut Its ald million less than Penn Central Railroad fatted to pay Its taxes The State ordered schools to cut class sizes to one teacher to every 25 students This caused the school board to have more teachers
