```json  
{ "foreign": bool, "contains-narrative": bool, "inflation-narratives": { "inflation-time": "past|present|future|not-applicable", "counter-narrative": bool, "causes": [ ["[cause label]", "past|present|future|not-applicable"], ... ], "effects": [ ["[effect label]", "past|present|future|not-applicable"], ... ] } } 
``` 
Note:  
- The "causes" and "effects" fields are optional. You can include one, both, or neither, depending on the content of the sentence.  
- If there are no causes or effects mentioned in the sentence, you can either omit the respective field entirely or include an empty array (e.g., "causes": [] or "effects": []).  
- If you do include causes or effects, each item should be a tuple containing the cause/effect label and the corresponding time (past, present, future, or not-applicable).
